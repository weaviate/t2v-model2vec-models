# Model2Vec Inference module

üéØ Overview
-----------

This is the the inference container which can be used with Weaviate
`text2vec-transformers` module. You can download it directly from Dockerhub
using one of the pre-built images.

It is built to support only static (`model2vec`) models.

[Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) models significantly
surpass other static embeddings models like GLoVe and BPEmb in performance,
and the pre-built Docker images containing these models are notably compact in size.
